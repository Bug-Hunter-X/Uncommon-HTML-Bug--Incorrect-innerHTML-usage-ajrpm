This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to using innerHTML with a non-string value. The bug is caused by assigning a numeric value directly to the innerHTML property.  This results in an unexpected behavior where the numeric value is not displayed correctly, unlike string values. The solution showcases how to use the toString() method to convert the number to a string before using it with innerHTML, resulting in the correct display.
